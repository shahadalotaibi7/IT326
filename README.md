Project Motivation: 

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women, affecting millions annually and accounting for 25% of all cancer cases globally. The ability to accurately distinguish between malignant (cancerous) and benign (non-cancerous) tumors is critical for timely and effective treatment. Misclassification can lead to delayed care or unnecessary interventions, impacting patient outcomes. 
By working on this problem, we aim to contribute to the understanding of breast cancer diagnosis while exploring how machine learning can address critical healthcare challenges
